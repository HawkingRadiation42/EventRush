## Project Explanation-
This project helps to ease the registration done during an event hosted by clubs in colleges/universities. The whole process of registration is done online mainly with the use of an email ID provided by the college. 
This platform also allows having a personal event calendar which shows the events which will be hosted in their respective College/University and also the event which the student registered for as shown on the Event Page.
After the registration is done an Email is sent to their (user) respective ID with a QR code which can be scanned and contains all the information to ease the registration process.
Making it just a Scan and Go process.

## Advantages-

2. Having a personal Event Calendar.
3. Help control the crowd.
4. Limit and give control to achieve a particular number of seats/targets.
5. Keep the student aware of the events happening.
